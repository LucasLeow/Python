== Naming conventions for Pytest ==
    - in order for python files to be recognized as test file

    - start with test_*.py
        eg:
            test_login.py

    - end with *_test.py
        eg:
            login_test.py

    - Any method within test file considered tests
    - method names must also follow convention
        eg:
        def testLogin():
            print("Login Successful")

        def testLogoff():
            print("Logoff Successful")

        def testCalc():
            assert 2+2 == 4

== running test files ==
    - cannot just run python file
    - must run with pytest framework
    1) inside pycharm -> top right corner -> dropdown -> edit configuration
    2) add new config -> pytest -> provide path to test file -> apply -> ok
    3) simply run (shift + F10) the file (since path already provided)
