== Pytest CLI ==
    - executing test files using pytest in CLI

    - typically used, especially for more complex projects
        - need to run multiple tests
    - use together with jenkins to build a job


    1) go to directory / package path where tests are located
    2) type "pytest" in command to execute

    Alternatively:
    1) At any directory
    2) pytest <path to dir containing tests>

    pytest -v <path> : provides info on each method within test files
    pytest -v -s <path> : provides execution of each test method as well
    pytest <path> -k log : execute test file methods with "log" within method name


    * Pytest will look into all dir & subdir for files with convention:
        *_test.py
        test_*.py
