== What are Pytest Fixtures ==
    - Tests are typically broken into 4 steps:
        1) Arrange
            - setup
            - prepare everything required for test
            - eg: to test adding to cart
                - need to launch browser
                - login
                - browse items in products
        2) Act
            - clicking the "add item to cart"
        3) Assert
            - verify if item has been added
            - check the cart if item added is really added
        4) Cleanup
            - logging off browser, closing app

   - Fixtures -
    - Everything in the "Arrange" and "Cleanup" steps


== Implementing Fixtures ==

    Inside test_addItem.py:

        import pytest

        @pytest.fixture or @pytest.yield_fixture() <- old version of pytest, syntax may still exist
        def setUp(): # code will actually be written to perform these actions, then selenium will execute
            print("Launch Browser")
            print("Login")
            print("Browse Products")
            yield
            print("Logoff")
            print("Close browser")

        def testAddItemToCart(setUp):
            print("Item added succesfully")

        def testRemoveItemFromCart(setUp):
            print("Item removed successfully")
