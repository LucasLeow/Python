    - Tree Structure
    - Creating General Tree in Python

== Tree Structure ==
    - Good for Parent-child r/s
    - hierarchical form
    - root, branches, leaf (no more children)
    - each entity in trees are known as nodes
        - Root nodes, nodes, leaf nodes (no child)

    - Other terminologies (ancestor | descendents)
    - Level 0: root, Level 1, Level 2 (can have n levels)

    - Binary Trees -
        - Each node at max 2 children
    
    - Trees are recursive data structures
        - child node is a Tree node itself

    eg: e-commerce website
    Electronic Products (Main parent) (root)
        - Laptops (Layer 1 child)
            - Apple Macbook (Layer 2 child)
            - Microsoft Surface (Layer 2 child)
            - Lenovo Thinkpad (Layer 2 child)
        - Cellphones (Layer 1 child)
            - iPhone
            - Google Pixel
            - Vivo
        - Televisions (Layer 1 child)
            - Samsung
            - LG


== Creating General Tree in Python == 

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.children = [] # each children will be instance of TreeNode
        self.parent = None

    def add_child(self, child): # child will be instance of TreeNode
        child.parent = self
        self.children.append(child)
