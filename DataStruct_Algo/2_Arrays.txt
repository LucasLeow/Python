== Arrays ==
    - most common & basic data structure
    - represented with a list in python
    - stored sequentially in memory


    Search by index:
        stocks = [1,2,3,4,5]
        stocks[0]
        stocks[1]


    Search by value:
        for i in range(len(stocks)):
            if(stocks[i] == 5):
                return i


    Print all values
        for price in stocks:
            print(price)


    Insert values (python)
        stocks.insert(idx, value)
        stocks.append(value) # append to end of list


    Delete values (python)
        stocks.pop(idx)
        stocks.remove(value)
    

Static vs Dynamic Arrays
    - Python list is dynamic by default

    Static:
        - fixed size

        Java: 
            int[] stocks = new int[5];

    Dynamic:
        - variable size (expand or contract depending on data)
        - once capacity reached, will create new memory location with size = <previous_size * 2>
            - copy all elements from old location to new location

            Java:
                ArrayList<Integer> stocks = new ArrayList<Integer>();


Python arrays can store different types of data
Other languages can only store type-specified data



== Multidimensional Arrays ==
    - array within array

        stocks = [
            [1,2,3,4],
            [5,6,7,8],
            [9,10,11,12]
        ]


== Language Implementation of Arrays ==
    Static:
        Java - native array
        c++ - native array

    Dynamic:

        Java - ArrayList<dtype>
        c++ - std::vector
