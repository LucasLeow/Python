== 1 Intro to DataStruct ==
    
    What are Data Structures?

        - Building blocks to create software applications
        - Software Applications = Algorithms (Instructions) + Data Structures

        - Need to use correct Data Structure for given problem
        - Each Data Structure have pros & cons

        - Different language have different implementation of data structures
        - data structures is conceptual


        Arrays:
            Python - List
            Java - Native Array | ArrayList
            c++ - Native array | std::vector

        Hashmap:
            Python - dictionary
            Java - HashMap | LinkedHashMap
            c++ - std::map
        
        LinkedList:
            Python - Not avail
            Java - LinkedList
            c++ - std::list




== 2 Big O notation ==

    - measure of:
        - running time
        - space requirements
    
        as input size grows
    

    - Measure of time (using stopwatch) is not feasible
        - different computers have different processing power
    - Mathematical representation of running time more feasible (big O)

    Actually have 3 notation:
        - best case scenario : Big Omega notation
            - fastest time, smallest memory

        - worst case scenario : Big O notation
            - slowest time, largest memory

        - average of best & worst : Big Theta notation
