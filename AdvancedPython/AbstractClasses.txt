Classes:
    - blueprint for objects

Abstract Classes:
    - blueprint for other classes
    - a class with 1 or more abstract method is an abstract class
    - abstract method = function declaration without implementation

    - By default, python does not have abstract classes
    - need to use "abc" module

    from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

    class Polygon(ABC):
        @abstractmethod
        def commonMethod(self):
            pass
    
    class Triangle(Polygon):
        def commonMethod(self):
            print("Implementation in Triangle")

    t = Triangle()
    t.commonMethod()
