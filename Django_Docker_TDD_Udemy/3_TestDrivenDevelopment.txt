== Unit tests ==
    - Code which tests code
        1) Set up condition
            - inputs to a function
        2) Run a piece of code
            - running a function
            - calling API endpoint
        3) check output of code
            - using assertions

    * Recommended that all developers write unit tests for all code developed
        - ensure code running as expected
        - catches any bugs / logical errors
        - improves reliability of code / app
        - will be notified if app not working as intended
        
== Test Driven Development (TDD) ==
    - Is a kind of Development practice
        1) Write test
        2) Run test (Fails)
        3) Add feature (code)
        4) Run Test (pass)
        5) Re-factor
        6) test again

    Benefits of writng test first:
        - better understand code
            - not just thinking of how to add feature
            - actually thinking of ho to test feature of code

== Test coverage ==
    - How much of project has unit test in place
    - Full coverage = all features have unit test
