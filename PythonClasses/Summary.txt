== 1 Classes & Instances ==
    - methods : functions within Classes
    - attributes : properties that a Class have
        - also known as instance variables
    
    class Employee:
        
        def __init__(self, first, last, pay):
            self.first = first
            self.last = last
            self.pay = pay
            self.email = first + "." + last + "@company.com"

        def get_fullName(self):
            return '{} {}'.format(self.first, self.last)



    emp_1 = Employee("Lucas", "Leow", 10000)
    print(emp_1.get_fullName)
    print(Employee.fullName(emp_1))

    - Class = blueprint for creating instances (objects)

    - __init__ is used as constructor for python Classes
    - when creating methods within class, it receives instance of class as first argument automatically
        - by convention, named as "self"

    - 2 ways to call methods:

        1) Through each instance
            - emp1.get_fullName()

        2) Through Class
            - Employee.get_fullName(emp1)
